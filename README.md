# Car Brand Recognition Neural Network

## Overview
As a child, I had great fun watching cars passing by and guessing their brands. Now I'm building a neural network to do the same task. Let's see who performs better!
## Features
- Pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification
- Data organized by car brand and a 'non-car' category
- Duplicate image removal using `imagededup`
## Dataset

This project uses the **Stanford Cars Dataset**.
