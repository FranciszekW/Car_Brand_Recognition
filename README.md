# Car Brand Recognition Neural Network

## Overview
As a child, I had great fun watching cars passing by and guessing their brands. Now I'm building a neural network to do the same task. Let's see who performs better!
## Features
- Leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNet
- Gathering and organizing a dataset comprising images from multiple car brands, ensuring
diverse representation
- Using data augmentation, learning rate scheduling to enhance model generalization
- Actively refining the model architecture and hyperparameters to improve accuracy and
robustness
## Dataset

This project uses the **Stanford Cars Dataset**.
